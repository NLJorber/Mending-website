A website about mending things made from fabric

This website is a little window into the art of mending fabric items. Often this means clothing but extends to other things too; chair seats, tents, rucksacks and household items like towels. Different items require different approaches and techniques, and individual preferences will affect the choices made.

 There are much more accomplished menders than me. There's a whole spectrum of skill involved, and there are different ways to approach it, depending on the result wanted and the way the item will be used. I will introduce some of these concepts here, but it's just a starting point.

The site is currently composed of three pages:
1: A little introduction on repairing, why it's great and how to approach it. 2: Some facts about fabric waste and mending. 3: Techniques that I like to use.
