# A website about mending things made from fabric

This website is a little window into the art of mending fabric items. Often this means clothing but extends to other things too; chair seats, tents, rucksacks and household items like towels. Different items require different approaches and techniques, and individual preferences will affect the choices made. 

Some of these techniques I have tried, some I have just heard about. There are much more accomplished menders than me. There's a whole spectrum of skill involved, and there are different ways to approach it, depending on the result wanted and the way the item will be used. I will introduce some of these concepts here, but it's just a starting point.

I will break the site down into sections:  
1: Information on techniques, fabric types, items and purposes. 
2: A brief history of mending fabrics.
3: Ways mending is utilised in the modern world.
