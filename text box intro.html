    <h1>Mending Fabrics</h1>
    <h2>Why repair?</h2>
    <p>The reasons are obvious – it stops fabric from ending up in landfill, it saves money, it reduces the amount of plastic swilling around in the world. My main motivator is just that I like doing it. It makes the things I own feel more mine. I also don’t like to throw things away, so mending validates my <i>slight</i> hoarder mentality</p>
    <h2>Downsides?</h2>
    <h3>It takes time to process, and it takes up space.</h3>
    <p>There is so much stuff in the world now that its value diminishes as availability increases, to the point that things become viewed more and more as disposable… unless we value everything! But that then means everything must be saved... In reality, sometimes you have to ignore the poor neglected things in that skip over there and accept that you have enough to take care of already. (See: My neverending sock darning bag.) It also makes places like clothes swaps, facebook selling groups and platforms like Vinted [link] very tricky places if you see everything as worthy of saving.</p> 
    <p>There is an argument that reselling things makes it easy to feel less guilty about buying more. I sometimes think the recent Marie Kondo [link] inspired explosion of declutterers and the concept of minimalism help us to forget all the stuff we’ve already owned… I like to think about all that stuff in landfill the way some people ponder the infinite universe.

<p>Marry someone who keeps you accountable for the pile of stuff you're accumulating. Hey, it worked for me. Or just accept that you can’t rescue everything, but you can learn some skills and avoid having to throw away your favourite items of clothing. Aim for doing (and saving) something, not all the things. </p>
